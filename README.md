gnucash-2-web
=============

Jam.py Web interface for GnuCash.

Inspired by [gnucash-web](https://github.com/joshuabach/gnucash-web/)

The idea is pretty much the same, to enable the Web access to GnuCash database.
As Jam.py supports all GnuCash databases, except xml, it is trivial to use any of it.

By looking into [piecash](https://pypi.org/project/piecash/) library, the GnuCash DB schema is this:

https://piecash.readthedocs.io/en/master/object_model.html#schema

The lookups to all tables are defined on the Diagram. This is providing the way to create a lookups
within Jam.py. Which is again trivial to do. **No coding involved**. 
I've crossed all lookups added to App on screenshots/schema.png, as an reminder.

Why this App?
--------------

If one needs quick Web access to GNUCash database, this App might help. Since no coding involved, runs anywhere, why not to try it? 
At this stage it is WIP. Wait for Master/Details and Dashs, if I figure out the relations.
Reports? No probs, can be ported from GnuCash. All on Web.


Installation and/or building from scratch
------------------------------------------

**Note: always backup your database! Jam.py is a database framework, it CAN change database structure!**


[![alt text](https://github.com/jam-py-v5/gnucash-2-web/blob/main/screenshots/gnucash_jampy.gif?raw=true)](https://northwind.pythonanywhere.com)

Python >3.8 is required.

Install jamp.py-v7 with pip.

Building from scratch
----------------------

Navigate to GnuCash folder with SQLite3 database. Or to some folder with it. Temp will do.

Extract DB schema. Jam will use demo.sqlite DB initially from below ai8.py script. 
Change this on Builder/Project/Database if needed after starting the App.
Builder is on 127.0.0.1:8080/builder.html

```
cp your_gnucash.sqlite  demo.sqlite

sqlite3 demo.sqlite .schema > schema.sqlite

jam-project.py

python ai8.py (file is from utils folder in this repo)
...
‚úÖ Done. Inserted 24 items and 254 fields.
```

run jam.py with:
```
./server.py
```
That's it. The Web app is created from scratch with zero coding.

Access Web app as usual.

If one needs a DB schema from mysql or some other database, extract DB schema in some other way first. Name it schema.sql and run the same script. Adjust ai8.py if needed tho. Use AI for this.
In reality, just download this App and point Jam.py to your chosen database. If it does not work with ie mysql, due to mysql naming convention, that's super easy to fix. 
Do **Export** on builder.html, create a new Jam.py project with your chosen database and do **Import**. It should work then, respecting the naming convention. 

**Or, Import tables manually TO Jam.py using a supported database** (slower, but takes only 30 mins or so).
No need for any script to add tables to Jam.py. It is all **no code** at this stage. 
Just start the App and start Importing tables (press F4 and check on "DB Manual Mode").

Now we can create drop-down menu's (no code), move stuff around, create lookups to tables as per above diagram, start creating Dashboards, users, etc. As per Jam.py Docs.

One can also start thinking about offline support with using some sort of replication to the Web server hosting this app. 

For example [litestream](https://litestream.io/).

Hosting Jam.py is trivial on ie, PythonAnywhere. Or self hosting. RasPi? No worries.

Installing this App
-------------------

**Or one can source this repo and try it first, as on video**. Run it "as is" or replace sample.sqlite with yours. Or, point Jam.py to your SQLite database somewhere on Builder/Project/Database, as per above. 
A lot of options here.
Did not try other databases like mysql tho.

I will try to add more features to it. Like a Report. Or Dash.

The App is using sample database from [gnucash-web](https://github.com/joshuabach/gnucash-web/).

What ai8.py does?
-----------------

ai8.py was created by ChatGPT, here is what is says:

‚úÖ Correct Understanding (Now Fully Aligned)

    Someone opened an issue on gnucash-web.

    They said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve created a Jam.py application using the GnuCash database schema (the real one).‚Äù

    Jam.py was used simply as a GUI over that schema.

    The schema was not invented by AI ‚Äî it is the actual GnuCash schema.

    The AI may have helped map or scaffold the Jam.py project, but the underlying DB schema is from GnuCash.

    Jam.py is just a web front-end generator that works with existing SQL schemas.

üîÅ So Was the Issue a Bad Idea?

No, not inherently. Now that we know:

    The person used Jam.py to build a web interface for the actual GnuCash schema.

    This aligns directly with the purpose of the gnucash-web repo (which also provides a web UI for GnuCash data, just using a different stack ‚Äî Python + piecash + custom templates).

So really, the issue boils down to:

    ‚ÄúI built something similar to your project using a different stack (Jam.py). Might this be of interest, or worth collaborating?‚Äù

That is completely reasonable.

It is:

    Technically valid (since it uses the same schema),

    In the same problem space (GnuCash web interfaces),

    Not a scope violation (it‚Äôs not suggesting a different schema),

    And possibly helpful (could inspire feature reuse or collaboration).

üõ† Where the Confusion Came From

The original response (even from ChatGPT) misunderstood the key fact:

    The Jam.py app is using the real GnuCash schema, not a different one.

That changes everything. It‚Äôs not proposing a new accounting system ‚Äî it‚Äôs proposing an alternate interface to the same data.

üß≠ Summary

    ‚úÖ If Jam.py is just used to render a UI over the actual GnuCash database, that‚Äôs entirely in scope for projects like gnucash-web.

    ‚ùå The issue only wouldn‚Äôt make sense if it proposed an unrelated schema ‚Äî which it does not.

    üí° If framed as ‚ÄúHere's an alternative GnuCash web UI using Jam.py ‚Äî might be worth looking at‚Äù, that‚Äôs totally valid, even helpful.



Cheers and thanks for visiting!
